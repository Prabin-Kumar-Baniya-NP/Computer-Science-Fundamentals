## 1. Simplex Mode

- <b>Definition</b>: Data Flow in one direction
- <b>Example</b>: Keyboard and monitor - Keyboard can only accept data from the users. Monitor can only display data from the users.
- <b>Advantage</b>: The station can utilize the entire bandwidth of the communication channel.
- <b>Disadvantage</b>: Communication is unidirectional.
