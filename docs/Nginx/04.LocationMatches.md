# Location Matches

## Nginx configuration

```
events {

}

http {

    server {

        listen 80;
        server_name nginx-handbook.test;

        location =/agatha {
            return 200 "Miss Marple.\nHercule Poirot.\n";
        }
    }
}
```
- Visit localhost/agatha, you will get this response
```
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
# Date: Wed, 21 Apr 2021 15:59:07 GMT
# Content-Type: text/plain
# Content-Length: 29
# Connection: keep-alive

# Miss Marple.
# Hercule Poirot.
```

- Adding an = sign before the location URI will instruct NGINX to respond only if the URL matches exactly. Now if you send a request to anything but /agatha, you'll get a 404 response.
