# Logging in Nginx

- By default, NGINX's log files are located inside /var/log/nginx. If you list the content of this directory, you may see something as follows:

```
ls -lh /var/log/nginx/

# -rw-r----- 1 www-data adm     0 Apr 25 07:34 access.log
# -rw-r----- 1 www-data adm     0 Apr 25 07:34 error.log
```
- Error messages have levels. A notice entry in the error log is harmless, but an emerg or emergency entry has to be addressed right away.

### There are eight levels of error messages:

- debug – Useful debugging information to help determine where the problem lies.
- info – Informational messages that aren't necessary to read but may be good to know.
- notice – Something normal happened that is worth noting.
- warn – Something unexpected happened, however is not a cause for concern.
- error – Something was unsuccessful.
- crit – There are problems that need to be critically addressed.
- alert – Prompt action is required.
- emerg – The system is in an unusable state and requires immediate attention.
