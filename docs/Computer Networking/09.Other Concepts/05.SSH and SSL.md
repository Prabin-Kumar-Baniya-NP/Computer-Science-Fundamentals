# SSL

- SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer.

- It is the standard security technology (a protocol) that offers secure communication between web servers and browsers (web clients) over an insecure network, such as the internet.

- It maintains the privacy and integrity of the data exchanged between a web server and browsers.

- It makes the data, which is shared between users and sites, impossible to read. It uses encryption algorithms to scramble data in transit, to prevent hackers from reading it. This data may be your bank login id and password, credit card details, social media login details, and other financial information, etc. For example, when you shop online, the details you share with the websites remain safe.
