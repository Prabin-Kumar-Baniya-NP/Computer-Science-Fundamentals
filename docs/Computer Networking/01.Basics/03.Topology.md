## Introduction

It defines the structure of network of how all the network devices are interconnnected with each other.

## Bus Topology
   The bus topology is designed in such a way that all the stations are connected through a single cable.<br>

## Ring Topology
   Ring topology is like a bus topology, but with connected ends.
   The node that receives the message from the previous computer will retransmit to the next node.

## Star Topology
   Star topology is an arrangement of the network in which every node is connected to the central hub, switch or a central computer.

## Tree Topology
   Tree topology combines the characteristics of bus topology and star topology. <br>

## Mesh Topology
   Mesh technology is an arrangement of the network in which computers are interconnected with each other through various redundant connections. <br>

## Hybrid Topology
   The combination of various different topologies is known as Hybrid topology. <br>
