# Joins

- PostgreSQL supports
  - inner join,
  - left join,
  - right join,
  - full outer join,
  - cross join,
  - natural join,
  - and a special kind of join called self-join.

```
basket_a
    a | fruit_a
    ---+----------
    1 | Apple
    2 | Orange
    3 | Banana
    4 | Cucumber
    (4 rows)

basket_b
    b |  fruit_b
    ---+------------
    1 | Orange
    2 | Apple
    3 | Watermelon
    4 | Pear
    (4 rows)
```

## Inner Join

- Returns the rows whose values are equal based on the "ON" condition.

- ![Inner Join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PostgreSQL-Join-Inner-Join.png)

```
SELECT
    a,
    fruit_a,
    b,
    fruit_b
FROM
    basket_a
INNER JOIN basket_b
    ON fruit_a = fruit_b;
```

```
 a | fruit_a | b | fruit_b
---+---------+---+---------
 1 | Apple   | 2 | Apple
 2 | Orange  | 1 | Orange
(2 rows)

```

## Left Join / Left Outer Join

- Returns the rows which are present in left table but not in right table (except common rows).

- ![Left Outer Join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PostgreSQL-Join-Left-Join.png)

```
SELECT
    a,
    fruit_a,
    b,
    fruit_b
FROM
    basket_a
LEFT JOIN basket_b
   ON fruit_a = fruit_b;
```

```
 a | fruit_a  | b | fruit_b
---+----------+---+---------
 1 | Apple    | 2 | Apple
 2 | Orange   | 1 | Orange
 3 | Banana   |   |
 4 | Cucumber |   |
(4 rows)
```

## Right Join / Right Outer Join

- Returns the rows from right table which are not present in left table (except common rows).

- ![Right Outer Join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PostgreSQL-Join-Right-Join.png)

```
SELECT
    a,
    fruit_a,
    b,
    fruit_b
FROM
    basket_a
RIGHT JOIN basket_b ON fruit_a = fruit_b;
```

```
 a | fruit_a | b |  fruit_b
---+---------+---+------------
 2 | Orange  | 1 | Orange
 1 | Apple   | 2 | Apple
   |         | 3 | Watermelon
   |         | 4 | Pear
(4 rows)
```

### Full Outer Join

- Returns rows from both left and right table.

- ![Full Outer Join](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PostgreSQL-Join-Full-Outer-Join.png)

```
SELECT
    a,
    fruit_a,
    b,
    fruit_b
FROM
    basket_a
FULL OUTER JOIN basket_b
    ON fruit_a = fruit_b;
```

```
 a | fruit_a  | b |  fruit_b
---+----------+---+------------
 1 | Apple    | 2 | Apple
 2 | Orange   | 1 | Orange
 3 | Banana   |   |
 4 | Cucumber |   |
   |          | 3 | Watermelon
   |          | 4 | Pear
(6 rows)
```

## Table Aliases

```
SELECT
	c.customer_id,
	first_name,
	amount,
	payment_date
FROM
	customer c
INNER JOIN payment p
    ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
ORDER BY
   payment_date DESC;
```

### Cross Join

- A CROSS JOIN clause allows you to produce a Cartesian Product of rows in two or more tables.

- Different from other join clauses such as LEFT JOIN or INNER JOIN, the CROSS JOIN clause does not have a join predicate.

  ```
  SELECT select_list
  FROM T1
  CROSS JOIN T2;
  ```

### Natural Join

- A natural join is a join that creates an implicit join based on the same column names in the joined tables.

- A natural join can be an inner join, left join, or right join. If you do not specify a join explicitly e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, PostgreSQL will use the INNER JOIN by default.

```
SELECT * FROM products
NATURAL JOIN categories;
```

is same as

```
SELECT	* FROM products
INNER JOIN categories USING (category_id);
```
