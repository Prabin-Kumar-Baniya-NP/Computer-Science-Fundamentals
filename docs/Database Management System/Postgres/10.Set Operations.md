# Set Operations

## UNION operator

- The UNION operator combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.

- The UNION operator removes all duplicate rows from the combined data set. To retain the duplicate rows, you use the the UNION ALL instead.

```
SELECT select_list_1
FROM table_expresssion_1
UNION
SELECT select_list_2
FROM table_expression_2
```

```
select * from product where id < 2
UNION
select * from product where id > 2;
```

```
 id |                        name                        | price |          country
----+----------------------------------------------------+-------+---------------------------

INTERSECT
select * from product where id IN (1,2,3,4,5);
```

```
 id |                        name                        | price |          country

SELECT column_list
FROM B
WHERE condition_b;
```

```
select * from product where id > 5
Except
select * from product where id IN (1,2,3,4,5);
```

```
 id |                        name                        | price |          country
