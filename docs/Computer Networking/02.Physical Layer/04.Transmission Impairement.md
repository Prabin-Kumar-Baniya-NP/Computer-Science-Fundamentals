# Transmission Impairement

When the received signal is not identical with that of transmitted signal, then the quality of signal is degraded. This is called transmission impairement.

## Causes of Transmission Impairement

1. <b>Attenuation</b><br>
   Attenuation means loss of energy i.e. the strength of signal decreases with increasing the distance which causes loss of energy.

2. <b>Distortion</b><br>
   Distortion occurs when there is change in shape of the signal. Each frequency componenet has its own propagation speed, so they reach at a different time which leads to distortion.

3. <b>Noise</b><br>
   When the data is transmitted over a medium, some unwanted siganl is added to it which causes the noise.
