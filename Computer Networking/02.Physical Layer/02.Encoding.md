# Digital to Digital Encoding / Conversion

When the binary 0's and 1's generated by the computer are translated into a sequence of voltage pulses that can be propagated over a wire, then this process is known as digital-to-digital encoding.

## Categories of Digital-to-digital Encoding

1. Unipolar
2. Polar
3. Bipolar

# Analog to Digital Encoding / Conversion

When an analog signal is digitalized, this is called an analog-to-digital conversion.
In analog-to-digital conversion, the information contained in a continuous wave form is converted in digital pulses.

## Techniques for analog to digital conversion

1. PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation)
2. PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)
