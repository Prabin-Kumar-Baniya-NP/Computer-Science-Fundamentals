# Session Layer

- This layer allows users on different machines to establish active communications sessions between them.

- It is responsible for establishing, maintaining, synchronizing, terminating sessions between end-user applications.

- In Session Layer, streams of data are received and further marked, which is then resynchronized properly, so that the ends of the messages are not cut initially and further data loss is avoided.

- This layer basically establishes a connection between the session entities. This layer handles and manipulates data which it receives from the Session Layer as well as from the Presentation Layer.
