# DBMS Normalization

- Process of organizating data in the database.

- Used to minimize the redundancy from the relation or set of relation.

- Divides the larger table into smaller table and links them using relationship.

- Normal Form is used to reduce the redundancy from the database table.

---

## Some Terminology:

### 1. Partial Dependency

- Partial Dependency occurs when a non-prime attribute is functionally dependent on part of a candidate key.
- In other words, A functional dependency X->Y is a partial dependency, if Y is functionally dependent on X, and Y can be determined by any proper subset of X.

### 2. Transitive Dependency

- When an indirect relationship causes functional dependency, it is called transitive dependency.
- Example: P -> Q and Q -> R then P -> R is a transitive dependency.

---

## Types of Normal Form:

### 1NF

- A relation is in 1NF if it contains an atomic value.

Example:
```sql
  Employee Table:
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  EMP_ID	   EMP_NAME	   	   EMP_PHONE	   	   EMP_STATE
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  14	   	   John	   	   7272826385,9064738238	UP
  20		   Harry		   8574783832		    Bihar
  12		   Sam		   7390372389,8589830302	Punjab
  -----------------------------------------------------------

  The decomposition of the EMPLOYEE table into 1NF has been shown below:

  -----------------------------------------------------------
  EMP_ID	   EMP_NAME	   	   EMP_PHONE	   	   EMP_STATE
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  14	   	   John	   	   	   7272826385		   	UP
  14	   	   John	   	   	   9064738238	   	    UP
  20	   	   Harry	   	   8574783832	   	    Bihar
  12	   	   Sam	   	   	   7390372389	   	   	Punjab
  12	   	   Sam	   	   	   8589830302	   	   	Punjab
  -----------------------------------------------------------
```

### 2NF

- A relation will be in 2NF if it is in 1Nf and all the non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key i.e it has no partial dependency.

Example: Let's assume, a school can store the data of teachers and the subjects they teach. In a school, a teacher can teach more than one subject.

```sql
TEACHER table
-----------------------------------------
TEACHER_ID      SUBJECT     TEACHER_AGE
-----------------------------------------
25              Chemistry	    30
25              Biology	        30
47              English         35
83              Math	        38
83              Computer	    38
-----------------------------------------
```

- In the given table, non-prime attribute TEACHER_AGE is dependent on TEACHER_ID which is a proper subset of a candidate key. That's why it violates the rule for 2NF.

- To convert the given table into 2NF, we decompose it into two tables:

```sql
  TEACHER_DETAIL table:
  ------------------------
  TEACHER_ID  TEACHER_AGE
  ------------------------
      25          30
      47          35
      83          38
  -----------------------

  TEACHER_SUBJECT table:
  -----------------------
  TEACHER_ID   SUBJECT
  -----------------------
      25      Chemistry
      25      Biology
      47      English
      83      Math
      83      Computer
  -----------------------
```

### 3NF

- A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and it deoesn't contain any transitive dependency for non-prime attributes.
- 3NF is used to reduce the data duplication.

### Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

- A relation is in BCNF if it is in 3NF and for every functional dependency X -> Y, X must be the super key of the table.
