# Basic Terminology

<b>Protocol</b> - A defined set of standards that computers must follow in order to communicate with other computers properly.

<b>Computer Networking</b> - The name we've given to the full scope of how computers communicate with each other.

## OSI VS TCP/IP Model

1. OSI model is a generic model that is based upon functionalities of each layer. TCP/IP model is a protocol-oriented standard.

2. OSI model gives guidelines on how communication needs to be done, while TCP/IP protocols layout standards on which the Internet was developed. So, TCP/IP is a more practical model.

## TCP/IP 5 Layer Network Model

1. <b>Physical Layer (Cables, Connectors)</b> - It represents the physical devices that interconnect computers.

2. <b>Data Link Layer (Ethernet, Wifi)</b> - It defines how these streams of bits are put together into manageable chunks of data.

3. <b>Network Layer (IP) </b> - It allows devices of different networks to communicate with each other.

4. <b>Transport Layer (TCP/UDP) </b> - It sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get the data.

5. <b>Application Layer (HTTPS, SMTP)</b> - It allows the user to interact with the application.

## Hub, Switch, Routers

- A Hub is a physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once.
- Switch is similar to a hub but a switch is a datalink layer device.
- A router is a device that knows how to forward data between independent networks. It is network layer device.
