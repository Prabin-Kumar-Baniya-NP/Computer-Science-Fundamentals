# Routing

- Routing is a process of selecting a path where data can be transmitted from source to destination.
- Routing is performed by a router that forwards the packet based on the information available in the packet header and forwarding table.
- Routers use Routing Tables to determine out which interface the packet will be sent.
- A routing table lists all networks for which routes are known.
- Each router’s routing table is unique and stored in the RAM of the device.
- A routing table is a set of rules, often viewed in table format, that is used to determine where data packets traveling over an Internet Protocol (IP) network will be directed. All IP-enabled devices, including routers and switches, use routing tables.

## Types of Routing

1. <b>Static Routing</b>: It is a technique in which the administrator manually adds the routes in a routing table.

2. <b>Default Routing</b>: This is the method where the router is configured to send all packets towards a single router (next hop). It doesn’t matter to which network the packet belongs, it is forwarded out to the router which is configured for default routing. It is generally used with stub routers. A stub router is a router that has only one route to reach all other networks.

3. <b>Dynamic Routing</b>: It is a technique in which a router adds a new route in the routing table for each packet in response to the changes in the condition or topology of the network.
