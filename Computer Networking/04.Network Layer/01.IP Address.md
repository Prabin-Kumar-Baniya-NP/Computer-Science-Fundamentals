# IP Address

- It is a 32 bit unique address having information about how to reach a specific host outside the network.
- It is used to locate a network device connected to other network.
- Example: <b>128.11.3.31</b>

## IP Address is divided into 5 subclasses

- An IP address consists of two components: a network ID and a host ID.
- The network ID identifies the network segment to which the host belongs.
- The host ID identifies an individual host on some specific network segment.

## IPv4 and IPv6

- IPv4 and IPv6 are internet protocol version 4 and internet protocol version 6, IP version 6 is the new version of Internet Protocol, which is way better than IP version 4 in terms of complexity and efficiency.
- <b>IPv4 is a 32 bit address but IPv6 is 128 bit address. </b>
- IPv4 has limited number of IP address but IPv6 has large number of IP address.
- In IPv4, end-to-end connection integrity is unachievable but in IPv6, end-to-end connection integrity is achievable.
- IPv4 doesn't provide encryption and authentication but IPv6 provides encryption and authentication.
