# Sub-query

- A subquery is a query nested inside another query such as SELECT, INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE.

## ANY

- ANY is equivalent to IN operator.

```
select * from product where id = ANY(Select id from product where id>2);
```

---

## ALL

- The PostgreSQL ALL operator allows you to query data by comparing a value with a list of values returned by a subquery.

- Syntax:

  ```
  comparison_operator ALL (subquery)
  ```

- The ALL operator must be preceded by a comparison operator such as equal (=), not equal (!=), greater than (>), greater than or equal to (>=), less than (<), and less than or equal to (<=).

- The ALL operator must be followed by a subquery which also must be surrounded by the parentheses.

```
select * from product
where
id > ALL(Select id from product where id <= 3);
```

```
 id |                        name                        | price |          country
----+----------------------------------------------------+-------+---------------------------
  4 | CG                                                 |   500 | NEPAL
  5 | Tesla                                              | 11500 | USA
  6 | Jio                                                |  1600 | INDIA
(3 rows)
```

## Exists / Not Exists

- The EXISTS operator is a boolean operator that tests for existence of rows in a subquery.

- If the subquery returns at least one row, the result of EXISTS is true.

- In case the subquery returns no row, the result is of EXISTS is false.

```
select * from product where exists (select id from product where id>=3);
```

```
 id |                        name                        | price |          country
