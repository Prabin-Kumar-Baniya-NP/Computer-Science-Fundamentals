# DBMS Checkpoint

- The checkpoint is like a bookmark.
- While the execution of the transaction, such checkpoints are marked, and the transaction is executed then using the steps of the transaction, the log files will be created.
- When it reaches to the checkpoint, then the transaction will be updated into the database, and till that point, the entire log file will be removed from the file.
- Then the log file is updated with the new step of transaction till next checkpoint and so on.
- The checkpoint is used to declare a point before which the DBMS was in the consistent state, and all transactions were committed.
