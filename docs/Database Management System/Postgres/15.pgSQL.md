# PL/pgSQL

- PL/pgSQL is a procedural programming language for the PostgreSQL database system.

- PL/pgSQL allows you to extend the functionality of the PostgreSQL database server by creating server objects with complex logic.

- PL/pgSQL was designed to :

  - Create user-defined functions, stored procedures, and triggers.
  - Extend standard SQL by adding control structures such as if, case, and loop statements.
  - Inherit all user-defined functions, operators, and types.

- PL/pgSQL wraps multiple statements in an object and store it on the PostgreSQL database server.

- Instead of sending multiple statements to the server one by one, you can send one statement to execute the object stored in the server.
