# Network Topology

It defines the structure of network of how all the network devices are interconnnected with each other.

### Types of Network Topology. [From Javatpoint]

1. <b> Bus Topology: </b>
   The bus topology is designed in such a way that all the stations are connected through a single cable.<br>

2. <b> Ring Topology: </b>
   Ring topology is like a bus topology, but with connected ends.
   The node that receives the message from the previous computer will retransmit to the next node.

3. <b> Star Topology: </b>
   Star topology is an arrangement of the network in which every node is connected to the central hub, switch or a central computer.

4. <b> Tree Topology: </b>
   Tree topology combines the characteristics of bus topology and star topology. <br>

5. <b> Mesh Topology: </b>
   Mesh technology is an arrangement of the network in which computers are interconnected with each other through various redundant connections.

6. Hybrid Topology: </b>
   The combination of various different topologies is known as Hybrid topology. <br>
