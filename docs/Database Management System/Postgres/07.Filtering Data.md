# Filtering Data

## Where clause

```
SELECT select_list
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY sort_expression
```

- Besides the SELECT statement, you can use the WHERE clause in the UPDATE and DELETE statement to specify rows to be updated or deleted.

- To form the condition in the WHERE clause, you use comparison and logical operators:
  ```
  =	          Equal
  >	          Greater than
  <	          Less than
  >=	          Greater than or equal
  <=	          Less than or equal
  <> or !=	  Not equal
  AND	          Logical operator AND
  OR	          Logical operator OR
  IN	          Return true if a value matches any value in a list
  BETWEEN	      Return true if a value is between a range of values
  LIKE	      Return true if a value matches a pattern
  IS NULL	      Return true if a value is NULL
  IS NOT NULL   Returns true if a value is not null
  NOT	          Negate the result of other operators
  ```

### Examples

```
select * from product where id in (1,2,3,4) AND price between 5000 AND 11000;
```

```
Select * from product where id >= 3 AND NOT(country is null);
```

```
select * from product where id is not null;
```

```
Select * from product where country <> 'CHINA' AND name Like '%a%';
```

## Limit Clause

- PostgreSQL LIMIT is an optional clause of the SELECT statement that constrains the number of rows returned by the query.

```
SELECT select_list
FROM table_name
LIMIT row_count OFFSET row_to_skip;
```

### Example

```
select * from product order by id Limit 2 offset 3;
```

```
 id |                        name                        | price |          country
----+----------------------------------------------------+-------+---------------------------
  4 | CG                                                 |   500 | NEPAL
  5 | Tesla                                              | 11500 | USA
```

## Fetch Clause

- To constrain the number of rows returned by a query, you often use the LIMIT clause.
- The LIMIT clause is widely used by many relational database management systems such as MySQL, H2, and HSQLDB.
- However, the LIMIT clause is not a SQL-standard.
- To conform with the SQL standard, PostgreSQL supports the FETCH clause to retrieve a number of rows returned by a query.

```
OFFSET start { ROW | ROWS }
FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ row_count ] { ROW | ROWS } ONLY
```

### Examples:

```
select * from product order by id
OFFSET 5 ROWS
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;
```
