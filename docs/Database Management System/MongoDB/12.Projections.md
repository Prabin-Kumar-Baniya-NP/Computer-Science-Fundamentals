# Projections

- It is a feature using which we can decide which field to show in the result.
- To include a certain fields use projection value of 1.
```sh
shop> db.comments.find({'comments': {$size: 4}}, {comments: 1})
[
  {
    _id: 1,
    comments: [
      { user: 'Alice', text: 'Great article!' },
      { user: 'Bob', text: 'Thanks for sharing.' },
      { user: 'Eva', text: 'Its beatifull!' },
      { user: 'jessy' }
    ]
  }
]
```
- To exclude a certain fields use projection value of 0.
```sh
shop> db.comments.find({'comments': {$size: 4}}, {comments: 1, _id: 0})
[
  {
    comments: [
      { user: 'Alice', text: 'Great article!' },
      { user: 'Bob', text: 'Thanks for sharing.' },
      { user: 'Eva', text: 'Its beatifull!' },
      { user: 'jessy' }
    ]
  }
]
```
- You can't include and exclude the fields at a same time. [Exception: _id can be exluded with comments included in the last example]
```sh
shop> db.comments.find({'comments': {$size: 4}}, {comments: 1, author:0, _id: 0})
MongoServerError: Cannot do exclusion on field author in inclusion projection

shop> db.comments.find({'comments': {$size: 4}}, {comments: 1, author:0})
MongoServerError: Cannot do exclusion on field author in inclusion projection
