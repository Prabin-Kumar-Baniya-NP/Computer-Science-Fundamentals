### 2. RARP [Reverse Address Resolution Protocol]

- It is a protocol which is used to obtain the IP address from a server.
- If the host wants to know its IP address, then it broadcast the RARP query packet that contains its physical address to the entire network.
- A RARP server on the network recognizes the RARP packet and responds back with the host IP address.
