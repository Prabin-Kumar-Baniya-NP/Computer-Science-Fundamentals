# Views

- PostgreSQL view is a logical table that represents data of one or more underlying tables through a SELECT statement.

- A view does not store data physically except for a materialized view.

- A view can be very useful in some cases such as:

  - A view helps simplify the complexity of a query because you can query a view, which is based on a complex query, using a simple SELECT statement.
  - Like a table, you can grant permission to users through a view that contains specific data that the users are authorized to see.
  - A view provides a consistent layer even the columns of underlying table changes.

- Creating View in Postgresql:

  ```
  CREATE VIEW view_name AS query;
  ```

- Altering View

  ```
  ALTER VIEW customer_master RENAME TO customer_info;
  ```

- Dropping a view
  ```
  DROP VIEW IF EXISTS customer_info;
  ```

### Materialized View

- PostgreSQL extends the view concept to the next level that allows views to store data physically. And these views are called materialized views.

- Materialized views cache the result of a complex and expensive query and allow you to refresh this result periodically.

- The materialized views are useful in many cases that require fast data access therefore they are often used in data warehouses and business intelligence applications.
