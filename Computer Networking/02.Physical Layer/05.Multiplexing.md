# Multiplexing

## Why Multiplexing

- The transmission medium is used to send the signal from sender to receiver. The medium can have one signal over a time.
- If there are multiple signal to share one medium, then the medium must be divied in such a way that each signal is given some portion of available bandwidth.
- When multiple signal share common medium, there is a possibility of collision. Multiplexing concept is used to avoid collision.

## Introduction to Multiplexing

It is a technique used to combine and send the multiple data streams over a medium. This process of combining the data stream is known as multiplexing and hardware used for multiplexing is called multiplexer. <br>

<b>Multiplexer</b>: Combines n input lines to generate a single output line. <br>
<b>Demultiplexer</b>: Separates a signal into its component signals.
