# Introduction

- React is a JavaScript Library that is used to build user interfaces.

- React and React DOM are two different library provided by react team. React.js is the core library where all the main core components of react is written. Whereas, React DOM is the library that is required to manipulate the browser DOM using react core library. These libraries are written separately because React is cross platform library. It is used to build apps on browser, mobile, desktops. So, we have different library for React DOM.

- Creating h1 tag using plain react.

```html
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script
    crossorigin
    src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
  ></script>
  <script
    crossorigin
    src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
  ></script>

  <script>
    const heading = React.createElement(
      "h1",
      { className: "heading" },
      "Hello World From React"
    );
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
    root.render(heading);
  </script>
</body>
```
