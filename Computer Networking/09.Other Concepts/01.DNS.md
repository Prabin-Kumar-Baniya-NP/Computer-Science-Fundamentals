# DNS

- DNS stands for Domain Name System.

- DNS is a directory service that provides a mapping between the name of a host on the network and its numerical address.

- DNS is a service that translates the domain name into IP addresses. This allows the users of networks to utilize user-friendly names when looking for other hosts instead of remembering the IP addresses.

- DNS uses UDP.
