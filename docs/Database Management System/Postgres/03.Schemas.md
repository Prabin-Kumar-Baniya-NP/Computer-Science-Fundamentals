# Introduction to Schemas in Postgresql

- In PostgreSQL, a schema is a namespace that contains named database objects such as tables, views, indexes, data types, functions, stored procedures and operators.

- A database can contain one or multiple schemas and each schema belongs to only one database.

- Two schemas can have different objects that share the same name.

For example, you may have sales schema that has staff table and the public schema which also has the staff table. When you refer to the staff table you must qualify it as follows:

```
public.staff
```

Or

```
sales.staff
```

- PostgreSQL automatically creates a schema called public for every new database. Whatever object you create without specifying the schema name, PostgreSQL will place it into this public schema.

### Create a new schema

```
create schema marketting;
```

### Create a new schema for a user

```
create schema sales authorization prabin;
```

### List all schema

```

```
