<small>From javatpoint </small>

- Nginx divided its job into the worker process and worker connections.
- Worker connections are used to manage the request made and the response obtained by users on the web server.
- At the same time, these requests are passed to its parent process which is called the worker process.

## Difference between apache and nginx

- Apache uses a multi-threaded approach to process client requests. But Nginx follows an event-driven approach to serve client requests.
- In Apache, a single thread can only process one connection. But in nginx, A single thread can handle multiple connections.
