# Relational Algebra

- It is procedural query language.

- It gives a step by step process to obtain the result of the query.

- It uses operators to perform queries.

## Types of Relational Operation

### 1. Select Operation

- Selects the tuples that satisfies a given predicate.

- Denoted by sigma (σ).

### 2. Project Operation

- Shows the list of those attributes that we wish to appear in the result.

- Denoted by ∏.

### 3. Union Operation

- Union operation contains all the tuples that are either in table A or B or both A and B.

- Notation: A∪B

### 4. Set Intersection:

- Suppose there are two tuples R and S. The set intersection operation contains all tuples that are in both R & S.
- Notation: R ∩ S

### 5. Set Difference:

- Suppose there are two tuples R and S. The set intersection operation contains all tuples that are in R but not in S.
- Notation: R - S

### 6. Cartesian Product:

- The Cartesian product is used to combine each row in one table with each row in the other table.
- Notation: R x S

### 7. Rename Operation:

- Rename the output relation.
- Denoted by rho(ρ)
