# DHCP

- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used to dynamically assign an IP address to any device, or node, on a network so they can communicate using IP (Internet Protocol).

- DHCP automates and centrally manages these configurations. There is no need to manually assign IP addresses to new devices. Therefore, there is no requirement for any user configuration to connect to a DHCP based network.

- DHCP can be implemented on local networks as well as large enterprise networks. DHCP is the default protocol used by the most routers and networking equipment.
