# ACID Properties

1. Atomicity

- Defines that data remains atomic.

- It means if any operation is performed on the data, either it should be executed completely or it should not be executed at all.

2. Consistency

- If there is any change in database, it should remain preserved always.

- In case of transaction, the integiry of data is very essential so that the database remains constant before and after the transaction.

3. Isolation

- In case of transaction, when two or more transactions occur simultaneously, the consistency should remain maintained.

- Any changes that occur in any particular transaction will not be seen by other transactions until the change is not commited into the memory.

4. Durability

- Durability ensures the permanency of something.

- Durability ensures that the data after the successful execution of the operation becomes permanent in the database.
